          <h1>ABOUT</h1>
          <p>Welcome to CoffeeMeetsPolished, a forum to share everything from what we enjoy when we are our bare-it-all selves with our first coffee of the day, to when we have to go out into the world as our more polished selves.</p>
          <p>My name is Erin and I'm an introvert, millenial, and self-proclaimed feminist with a career as a healthcare professional and leader. In June 2017, I completed a residency program that was an ironic experience where you're too swamped to focus on yourself but get broken to the point where you learn a lot about who you are. Through the serial burnout and rising from the ashes I was empowered to embrace my strengths (and many quirks), seek and accept help, and pursue personal passions - not just professional ones.</p>
          <p>I created this blog in my late-20's to share my continuous quest for the appropriate level of integration of personal and professional life. Itâ€™s my hope that you may be able to relate or find tools that will work for you. Thanks for joining, and welcome!</p>
