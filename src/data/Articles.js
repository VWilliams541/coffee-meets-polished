<p>I fully admit one of my guilty pleasures is binge-watching YouTube "beauty influencers". Whatever your skin type is and daily routine, it takes trial and error to find out what works for you. The Q&A below is for reference for you to know it doesn't always have to be a 10-step foundation routine to look flawless. Don't get me wrong, I have a lot of fun putting on makeup and when I know I have an evening event, I will plan to spend a lot of time on it. But for every day and getting ready for a long work day, what matters is what makes you feel comfortable and confident to take on your challenges.</p>
<p><b>What is your skin type?</b></p>
<p>I have oily skin, lucky me! I have occasional breakouts that leave pigmented scars. If you have oily skin too, I'm happy to share my tricks to controlling shine throughout the day. Hint - it starts with skin care.</p>
<p><b>What is your skin color and undertone?</b></p>
<p>I'm a Filipina and my skin color is brown with neutral undertones. For color reference, I use MAC NW 44, Revlon Colorstay Combination/Oily in Toast (370), and Maybelline Matte Fit Me Matte + Poreless Foundation in Natural Tan (320).</p>
<p><b>What tools do you use?</b></p>
<p>I've gone through a few different brushes, by my default brush to to blend out my foundation is the Morphe M439. I love how dense and short the bristles are and having the curved top as opposed to a flat top is more comfortable on the face. When I'm not too lazy to soak a Beauty Blender, I will use that too. But when I'm half awake in the morning on autopilot I pick up the brush.</p>
<p><b>How do you prep your face for foundation?</b></p>
<p>The very first thing I do when I wake up and before any makeup application is to wash it. I only do soap and water. I put on some lotion and wait 10 minutes, then I'm ready to go. This is usually when I start my coffee for the morning. As far as primer, I don't actually use those as much but I'm investigating some oil-control ones - stay tuned!</p>
<p><b>What do you use to set your face?</b></p>
<p>I keep it simple with powder to set the foundation. I find this to be essential if you have oily skin. Pictured is Estee Lauder Double Matte Oil-Control Pressed Powder in Medium/Deep (04). As you can see it's hitting pan and I plan to replace it with Maybelline Fit Me Pressed Powder next!</p>
<p><b>What are products you don't use every day?</b></p>
<p>When I'm getting ready for work in the morning, I keep it simple but effective. I don't use concealer under the eyes, instead I do a second layer of foundation. I don't use any sort of setting spray. And I don't contour/bronze. I am interested in pursuing this someday but for now, I only use blush and highlight.</p>

{id: "4", title: "4 Considerations for Picking Weekend Brunch + My Favorite UWS Spot", date: "August 17, 2017", category: "Food", post:
<div>
<img src="/images/brunch-bloody-mary.jpg" alt="Bloody Mary" />
<p>One thing I learned quickly when moving to New York City was that brunch is a big deal. Every restaurant open has a brunch special of some sort. My boyfriend and I came up with our criteria for picking a place to actually stop and sit. Below are 4 considerations we have, along with some tips for the optimal experience in the end.</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>Bottomless drink option vs. lower glass per glass.</b> Of course, drinks are the best part of brunch. There are options for a mimosa, blood Mary and bellini in many locations. Looking through different places there were some with $5 per drink options, and other discounted prices. But if you're not in a rush and you feel you'll drink more than 2 glasses, go for the bottomless option. With these morning cocktails ranging from $11-15, you can reap the benefits of the bottomless drink price after 2-3 drinks. Deciding between choices requires a little bit of calculation but worth the cost-savings in the end.</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. <b>Unlimited time for bottomless drinks.</b> If you find a spot with bottomless drinks, check the fine print. Some places will have a time limit to keep a table. This makes total sense from a business perspective, but as a consumer if you want to be somewhere for a few hours to optimize your cost per drink ratio, unlimited time options exist!</p>
<p className="tabbed">3. <b>See if you can eat at the bar.</b> In case you can't find a place that has unlimited time for your bottomless drinks, eat at the bar. This eliminates depending on your waiter/waitress for refills.</p>
<p className="tabbed">4. <b>Research the menu.</b> This one is obvious. You'll want to eat with all of the bottomless drinks. Make sure the menu looks good!</p>
<p>Where's my favorite brunch place so far? In my neighborhood on the Upper West Side, that would be <a href="http://www.ellakitchenbar.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Ella Kitchen & Bar</a>. This place hit all of the criteria. Bottomless drink option between mimosa, bloody mary, bellini, and cava for $17 with no time limit that we could see on the menu (we stayed ~1.5 hours). We ate at the bar and our bartender didn't let our glasses empty. We were able to switch between types of drinks - not sure if this was a bartender perk, but it didn't state against it on the menu. And the food. was. delicious.</p>
<img className="landscape" src="/images/brunch-cream-eggs.jpg" alt="Cream Eggs"/>
<p><b>Smoked Salmon Baked Eggs.</b>Three eggs, multigrain toast & home fries. Eggs are cooked with heavy cream & parmesan cheese. Smoked salmon with chives, dill & cream cheese. This was so sinfully good with the cream and cheeses. It came out on a cast iron platter, allowing the parmesan cheese to continue cooking into a delicious crust. The cream cheese was splattered in dollops and served as a scrumptious surprise since they were camouflaged with the cream and egg whites. I would order this every single time.</p>
<img className="landscape" src="/images/brunch-wellington.jpg" alt="The Wellington"/>
<p><b>Wellington Eggs Benedict.</b>Poached eggs on house-baked English muffin, roasted chile hollandaise & home fries. Grass-fed skirt steak & sauteed spinach. My boyfriend got this meal, and let's just say there was no leftover. Can you blame him?</p>
<p>Where are your favorite brunch spots, and how do you pick them?</p>

{id: "3", title: "10 Tips for Orienting Yourself to a New Job", date: "August 16, 2017", category: "Career", post: 
<div>
<img src="/images/orienting-yourself.jpg" alt="First Day!"/>
<p>I started my first training-wheels-off job last Monday and most things are different from where I trained. The culture, the people, the protocols, etc. As a resident, I was one of the Chief Residents for Orientation where I helped coordinate on-boarding 35 Pharmacy Residents. With my specialty training I also coordinated on-boarding of new Managers while on rotations, and had lectures on the importance of getting a good start as part of my Masters degree.</p>
<p>An effective orientation is like getting a good first impression. It can say a lot about an institution's overall organization and how engaged your hiring manager is. A quality orientation experience can improve employee retention and engagement in the long run. This means less employee turnover and apathy, better team morale, and cost savings (training is expensive!).</p>
<p>With all of the didactic training and coordination of orientation schedules/experiences for others, it's time to create the effective experience for myself.  One of the most empowering lessons that I learned from my mentors is to prepare to orient yourself. Own it!</p>
<p>Below are 10 tips that I will be implementing for at least the next few months.</p>
<p className="tabbed">		1. <b>Keep an open mind.</b> You don't know what you don't know. Seek to understand. All of these phrases basically mean, shut up and listen. Don't kid yourself thinking that you know, well, anything. It's a great place to be for now - embrace it.</p>
<p className="tabbed">		2. <b>What got you here won't get you there.</b> Similar to the previous one, don't think that the knowledge you had that got you hired is what is going to make you the most successful. Keep your cards to yourself until you understand the organization first. Blow their minds with your abilities after you've earned their trust.</p>
<p className="tabbed">		3. <b>Focus on building relationships.</b> You are not a one person show. If you are onboarding to a new organization, large or small, everyone has a place. And relationships are key. Get a feel for who you can go to for certain needs, who could be a mentor, and who can collaborate with in the future.</p>
<p className="tabbed">		4. <b>Get lost.</b> Try to find places on your own (but don't be afraid to ask for directions so you're not late!). By walking places on your own instead of having someone escort you, you'll get lost less in the long run. And you may even find some secret spots to have lunch in solitude.</p>
<p className="tabbed">		5. <b>Bring paper and pen.</b> It still sets a good first impression than taking notes on a mobile device. I always start with writing things down in my moleskin notebook until I see examples of otherwise.</p>
<p className="tabbed">		6. <b>Under promise and over deliver.</b> Your career is a marathon, not a sprint. All of my mentors have advised not to join too many committees, promise too many deliverables to start, etc. Be a productive and effective team member and understand the culture/politics around you. When the time is right, flex your muscles.</p>
<p className="tabbed">		7. <b>Trust the process.</b> Remember that while all organizations have room for improvement, you do not have the historical context behind decisions that give you the bandwidth to make any change recommendations just yet. Trust the process, keep notes of what went well and what didn't, and when the time is right discuss these opportunities with your hiring manager.</p>
<p className="tabbed">		8. <b>Communicate.</b> Over communicate with your hiring manager. The more you communicate now, the more trust you will build with your boss. Communicate when you are unsure. You will likely have different people orienting you throughout the process and people will over- or under-assume you know anything. Tell your trainers upfront where you are in the process, and don't let them assume you know something you don't. On the other hand, don't let your trainers speak too long about things you already know because that wastes everyone's time. Speak up for yourself - this is your time and sets the platform for the rest of your time at the institution.</p>
<p className="tabbed">		9. <b>Build good habits from day 1.</b> This is your opportunity to set your environment within appropriate bounds. Your email is empty so you can start your organization system from scratch. You can create your boundaries for working after hours/weekends now (unless your boss has different expectations). If you build good habits now, it will help in the long run for resilience in the workplace and happiness at home.</p>
<p className="tabbed">		10. <b>Start with the basics.</b> Learn where the bathroom is, how to clock in, make sure you get paid.</p>
<p>Stay tuned to see if these tips worked for me in the long run. I hope some of these will work for you.</p>

{id: "2", title: "When The Graduations End", date: "August 15, 2017", category: "Life", post:
<div>
<img src="/images/graduation-end.jpg" alt="graduation:" />
<p>I was raised in a family and culture where education meant success. If you did well in school, the rest of your life would fall into place. Well, I've gotten a lot of higher education throughout the past couple of decades with three degrees to my name (BS, PharmD, MS). And while I've held jobs as I progressed through my coursework, and staffed as part of my residency program, the graduation days have finally ended and the training wheels are off. At 28 years old, I officially have entered the next step of my career.</p> 
<p>What's funny about it is that I feel like I'm learning the same #adulting struggles now as those just finishing their undergraduate degrees. Except now I'm in much more debt and haven't been able to hold a saving's account because of school. Coming out of it and transitioning to the workforce, I wonder if it was worth it. At times I feel really behind after all of those long days, sleep lost, and money left on the table. I'm in my late 20's and just learning about 401k's, taxable income, and health insurance (despite being a healthcare professional). But at least I know how to cook?</p> 
<p>The truth is, without all of the experiences I had before today I wouldn't be exploring New York City with someone I love, with the potential for amazing new experiences ahead of us. Yes, I've spent a lot of my life studying and struggling, but I learned so much along the way. I learned a lot about life, what I want from it, and how to get it. I've gained independence and perspective that had I rushed out into the real world a decade earlier I may not have in the same way.</p> 
<p>What I've learned is that when the graduation days end, life is just beginning. There is still so much more to learn and I choose to see it as a fun challenge. If you're in a similar boat where you are coming into the workforce feeling behind, I encourage you to take on the challenge with a positive perspective. Take value in where you came from, the mistakes you made, and accomplishments you earned. Use them to take on the unknown future and make it what you want.</p>

<p>Welcome to Coffee Meets Polished, a forum to share everything from what we enjoy when we are our bare-it-all selves with our first coffee of the day, to when we have to go out into the world as our more polished selves.</p>
<b>Who are you?</b>
<p>My name is Erin and I'm an introvert, millenial, and self-proclaimed feminist with a career as a healthcare professional and leader.</p>
<p>I studied Biology at the University of Florida and moved to North Carolina for pharmacy school at UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy. While in pharmacy school I led a Communications and Social Media Management team for a national pharmacy organization where I discovered a new skill set and creative avenue to engage audiences. We focused on sharing stories of other student pharmacists to create a national platform idea promotion and collegiality.</p>
<p>Once I became a licensed pharmacist, I stayed in Chapel Hill two more years for residency where I specialized in Health-System Pharmacy Administration (yes, that's a specialty). Residency was an ironic experience where you're too swamped to focus on yourself but get broken to the point where you learn a lot about who you are. Through the serial burnout and rising from the ashes I was empowered to embrace my strengths (and many quirks), seek and accept help, and pursue personal passions - not just professional ones.</p>
<p>Now I'm in New York City pursuing the next step in my professional career in a brand new environment but finally without the training wheels on. Luckily I get to have my love by my side, too. You'll get to meet him throughout the journey!</p>
<b>Ok, but why did you start this blog?</b>
<p>I created this blog to share my story in hopes that if others can relate, they realize they're not alone. I feel most myself when I wake up on a Saturday morning and drink coffee while catching up on my YouTube subscriptions. But I also feel myself in wedges and a blazer managing projects and taking care of patients. One cannot exist without the other. This blog represents my continuous quest for the appropriate level of integration (not balance) of my personal and professional lives.</p>
<b>But, what do I get out of it?</b>
<p>It’s my hope that you may be able to relate or find tools that will work for you to create the necessary boundaries between home and work to maintain resilience and happiness. At a minimum, my goal is that you leave this page feeling happy with you who are. If I'm lucky, you'll feel empowered to make a difference in the world.</p>
<p>Thanks for joining, and welcome!</p>
