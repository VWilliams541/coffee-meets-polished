<p>I’ve mentioned before that I’m pretty new when it comes to feminism. I would say I “woke up” about two years ago, and new things are still becoming evident to me every day. I’ve embarked on the never-ending, ever-evolving journey of feeling self-empowered, and part of this is working on my feminism literacy by opening my eyes to the environment around me. If you’re new to feminism and wanting to find a place to start, this list will help give you a taste. With these, you can start dipping your toes in the water to question societal norms and begin changing the conversation.</p>
<p>1. <b>No trash bins in bathroom stalls.</b> This one just makes me think there wasn’t a woman at the table helping design the bathroom, when there definitely should be. And I also get frustrated that I have to take my tampons outside of the stall and put in a communal trash.</p>
<p>2. <b>Luxury tax on tampons.</b> Just… why? The only reason I (and even <a href="https://youtu.be/8c2Ro54Alkk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">President Obama</a> can think of is that only men were at the table when the tax laws were developed. Just in 2016 alone there was a large movement by states to make changes to this. You can read about those <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/01/08/the-tampon-tax-explained/?utm_term=.3ba757520b05" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></p>
<iframe width='480' height='290' scrolling='no' title="Tampon Tax" src='https://player.washingtonpost.com/prod/powaEmbed.html?adBar=true&autoinit=true&org=wapo&playthrough=true&uuid=1ba4f204-b5f7-11e5-8abc-d09392edc612' frameborder='0' webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>3. <b>Dress code.</b> This is one I’ve been thinking a lot about recently after seeing a photo of a protest sign that said “<a href="https://thetab.com/us/2016/06/16/clothes-not-give-consent-16604" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">My clothes are not my consent</a>.” In high school I remember rules about whether I could wear spaghetti straps and not show any belly skin. In my opinion, these dress codes exist is to not distract boys and men who “can’t help but look”. The very principle of this has roots in rape culture, slut-shaming, and body image woes.The concept of dress codes were recently challenged in the US Congress when an antiquated dress code was enforced about <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40618356" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">showing shoulders</a>, and some boys have joined to <a href="http://time.com/4829073/boys-skirts-protest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">protest</a> in <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/dress-code-protest-off-the-shoulder-tops" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">high schools</a> (this is what I like to see!).</p>
<p>4. <b>Need for paid family leave.</b> I believe this to be one of the largest contributors to gender inequality and institutional fostering of gender roles at a woman’s disadvantage. The <a href="https://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)</a> requires companies with more than 50 employees to provide job protection for 12 weeks unpaid leave. When I first learned about this through Human Resources Management training in residency, I had to ask again to clarify that it was <b>unpaid</b>. The instructor confirmed I heard correctly. I plan to have an entire post about research from other countries and current large companies that are starting to catch up, but for now I’ll leave this video here.</p>
<p><iframe title="Paid Family Leave" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FIllumeably%2Fvideos%2F267142393690868%2F&show_text=0&width=476" width="476" height="476" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allowFullScreen="true"></iframe></p>
<p>5. <b>Marketing strategies to women.</b> I fully admit that I know when something is marketed to me that I feel a desperate want for, but most certainly don’t need. I’m at a point where I can recognize this and make choices whether to scratch that itch or not. However, in the big picture of things the market strategies create a female identity that automatically leaves each individual to counter and defend a particular market she doesn’t subscribe to. As women, we should be empowered to create our own identities and not be capitalized on by businesses trying to create our story. After all, we are the <a href="https://hbr.org/2009/09/the-female-economy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">largest consumers</a>in the market.</p>
<p>6. <b>Only “his” instead of “his or her”.</b> Whenever I read an article or listen to the TV, I’ve begun noticing every time a statement only has “his” instead of “his or her”. I’d be interested to see a book that wasn’t specifically about a woman that used “her” as the default.</p>
<p>7. <b>Importance of access to contraceptives.</b> Family planning allows women all over the world to make choices about her future. It saddens me that politics, religion, and sexism play a role in depriving women of making these choices on their own. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/melindagates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Melinda Gates</a> has become someone I follow to stay informed about the need, especially in developing countries.</p>
<p><iframe title="Contraceptive Access" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fmelindagates%2Fvideos%2F10155753603373072%2F&show_text=0&width=476" width="476" height="476" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allowFullScreen="true"></iframe></p>
<p>8. <b>Changing last names after marriage.</b> I’ve started creating a database in my mind of women who changed their last name, hyphenated, or not changed at all. I’ve spoken with both men and women about what resulted after marriage with mixed responses for the reasoning behind their choices. The bottom line for me is that it should be a decision that is ultimately the woman’s choice.</p>
<p>9. <b>Masculinity.</b> I say a lot that I wish there was a different word for “feminism” because it truly is about challenging societal norms around gender identity as a whole. A lot of what plagues women today is an indirect result of the pressure society puts on men’s masculinity.  One of the biggest challenges for me is that men are (in general) raised to suppress emotion and thus equating emotion as weakness. This translates to men being emotionally unstable and can (in)directly affect treatment of women and also brand an “emotional” woman as weak.</p>
<p><iframe title="Masculinity" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fbbctwo%2Fvideos%2F10155359731070659%2F&show_text=0&width=476" width="476" height="476" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allowFullScreen="true"></iframe></p>
<p>10. <b>Intersectionalism.</b> I started hearing about this “third wave” of feminism being branded as <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/01/19/feminism-intersectionality-racism-sexism-class/96633750/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">intersectional</a> and realized I needed to learn a lot more about it. A very basic understanding can be explained by the fact that women can have more or less disadvantage to find opportunity based a combination of her race, sexual orientation, gender identity, nationality, language, religion, economic class, etc. In the big picture of diversity around the world, people have different privilege and disadvantage depending on which intersection you are look into. In order to recognize these intersections we must first understand our own privilege. Then we can begin to disentangle a “woman” from an “African American woman” and from a “Muslim transgender woman”.</p>
<p>This is not meant to be man-bashing or diminish the struggles that men also go through. I just hope this helps give you a starting place to open your eyes and see some of the most basic and common things that happen right under our noses may in fact be an opportunity to create positive change that benefits everyone. It’s as easy as staying curious, asking questions, and having a conversation.</p>

After attending seminars and reading so much about the art of finding balance, every pursuit almost always lead to feelings of failures and disappointment. I propose we change the conversation to set boundaries instead.</p> <a href="/articles/19">[Read More]</a></div>, post: 
<div>
<img src="/images/boundaries.jpg" alt="Boundaries" />
<p>The constant battle of humans is to find balance in our lives with everything going on. The concept of having balance insinuates that within 24 hours of each day we must equally divide them between the activities we want to accomplish. 8 hours work + 8 hours play + 8 hours sleep. If we polled everyone in the world I would bet that is something less than 1% of the population actually achieves.</p>
<p>After 6 years of post-undergraduate school work, and the past two years as a pharmacy resident I am no stranger to the challenge of finding purpose in work and personal life when one held the keys to the future I need to pay of all of my loans and the other held the key to mental survival. I went through phases of being extremely UN-balanced and without ANY boundaries. I’ve attended seminars and read many articles about the art of finding balance, but the pursuit almost always leads to feelings of failure and disappointment.</p>
<p>Does that mean we are hopeless to never find balance? Are we doomed to lives of either all work or all play (and no sleep)?</p>
<p>Mentorship from those who also found balance a dead end goal has instilled in me the desire to dump the balance and instead set <b>boundaries</b>. Throughout residency I tried to set boundaries instead of balance. Many (MANY) times I failed, but I learned a lot along the way.</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>Set the boundaries.</b> You can’t ensure boundaries aren’t crossed if you don’t name them. Decide what time you want to turn the email off, when you want to go to bed at night, etc. Have a transparent conversation with your boss, teammates, and family about your boundaries and work with them through it. Embrace that you have needs – everyone does.</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. <b>Be willing to change the boundaries fluidly.</b> Don’t feel guilty about needing to break your own “rules”. Boundaries are not set in stone, especially since rarely anything in life is. Similar to the first tip, should a change be needed due to current events in your life, keep having having conversation.</p>
<p className="tabbed">3. <b>Have support structures around you to keep you accountable.</b> Surround yourself with people who enrich and fulfill your life, make you feel empowered to achieve your goals but also keep you in check when you’re falling into your Hobbit hole.</p>
<p className="tabbed">4. <b>Start small.</b> Like any skill, it takes practice and strength to flex your boundary-setting muscles. Start by setting a boundary that isn’t threatening and incrementally raise the bar to others. For me, I started with not using my phone when I was out on a date with my boyfriend. One of the more challenging ones was not checking my email after 7:00PM.</p>
<p>The key here is to know that there will be times of imbalance in our lives and to make these choices with purpose. Be open and honest with your needs and this will take you far in your pursuit of boundaries.</p>

<img src="/images/fall.jpg" alt="Fall" />
<p>As a Puerto Rican by birth, Floridian by childhood, Filipina by blood, I’m simply not made to love the cold weather. My blood is thinner and my biological thermometer is more sensitive (sounds scientific enough, right?) to any Fahrenheit readings below 75(ish) degrees. I grew up on the beachside of Central Florida, where there was no point in straightening your hair except for a few weeks in January (thank you, humidity), where freeze warnings meant bringing your plants inside overnight, and anything that required me to wear closed-toed shoes meant I was shivering.</p>
<p>That being said, I did live in North Carolina for 6 years as a warm up for New York City. One of the things people who know me are excited about seeing is my reaction to a Northeast winter. But that’s not for a whole season. We still have fall! If you know a Floridian, you’ve seen their wonder at the leaves changing to reds, oranges, and yellows. I still get these feelings 6 years later. But I have come to love a few more things that associate with the crisp, cool fall air that I’m excited to experience in New York City.</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>Pho.</b> Anyone else with me? I love a huge bowl of pho on a cool day to keep me warm from the inside.</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. <b>Peacoats.</b> I didn’t own my first peacoat until I moved to North Carolina when I was 22 years old. But now that I have a few I love the style!</p>
<p className="tabbed">3. <b>Leaves changing in Central Park.</b> As I said before, I still find the leaves changing to be one of the Wonders of the World. And in one of the best parks in the world? ‘Nuff said.</p>
<p className="tabbed">4. <b>Not melting in the subways.</b> Subways don’t have air conditioning. They are about 50 degrees hotter than whatever temperature it is outside. You can do the math.</p>
<p className="tabbed">5. <b>Fall makeup/nail polish colors.</b> I’m not one for makeup rules, but the muted warm tones and deep berry colors are some of my favorites to rock out on my lips, eyes, and nails in the fall.</p>
<p className="tabbed">6. <b>Keeping windows open.</b> In our brownstone apartment, we don’t have central air conditioning. I’m pretty excited to remove our window units to make way for keeping the windows open. Thank you Upper West Side and your cleaner outside air.</p>
<p className="tabbed">7. <b>Mulled wine.</b>I love making mulled wine. The temperature and spice warmth combined is perfect to cozy up with a movie on the couch. Friends optional. Here’s one of my favorite recipes from <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/mulled-wine-recipe-1950801" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ina Garten</a>.</p>
<p className="tabbed">8. <b>Apples.</b> Apple combined with cinnamon in any form during the fall is the best. Cider, pie, applesauce, apple butter, donuts… okay brb going to buy some apples.</p>

<img src="/images/owned-introversion.jpg" alt="Owned Introversion" />
<p>For the first couple of decades of my life, I didn’t know I was an introvert. I just thought I was quiet and didn’t like crowds. Thinking back, I was always reading a book at Filipino socials, preferring to have one-on-one conversations at house parties, and never wanting to go out to the clubs in college (but I did it anyway). Once I got to pharmacy school I learned a lot more about introversion because of one professor who had all of us take the <a href="http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/home.htm?bhcp=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Myers-Briggs test</a> as a part of learning more about ourselves and how to work in teams.</p>
<p>Taking the Myers-Briggs personality test and reading the description of my results was like reading my biography. It felt like validation for the feelings and needs I’ve had growing up that I didn’t know how to express. This isn’t meant to sound dramatic because I’ve had a happy life and am fortunate to not have been bullied or anything like that, but understanding these things about myself, my introversion, was eye-opening.</p>
<p>Once I identified as an introvert, the journey to owning it and feeling confident about it was a different story. It still took a while for me to say no to certain social gatherings after a long day of class/work. It wasn’t until years later in residency where I reached a point (alongside everyone else) where if I didn’t own my needs, I would mentally break. I’m not saying everyone needs to reach a breaking point to know how to get what you want, but this is how my journey played out.</p>
<p>Now that I’m in my career, living on my own in a new city with my boyfriend, I have a clean slate. This is the first clean slate I’ve had with this newfound confidence and pride in my personality and my needs. If you’re in a similar boat as me and working on your own sense of self, here are six ways I’ve learned to own your introversion.</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>Understand your needs.</b> It took a while for me to realize that what seemed like quirks are really just facets of my personality and there is NOTHING wrong with it. Things that helped were reading books like Quiet, reading articles about other introverts like Eleanor Roosevelt, Warren Buffet, and Rosa Parks. I also have mentors who are introverts that have gone through a similar journey as me. Essentially, realize you are NOT alone and you are awesome as you are.</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. <b>Acknowledge how your needs may be perceived.</b> Intention and perception are not always in sync. I’ve been told that I’m unemotional, seem uninterested, and like I’m blowing people off. Now that I understand more about myself, I don’t take offense to this. In fact, now I appreciate the feedback so I can 1) clarify and 2) make some adjustments by adding some explanation with my actions in real time. To the comments that I may seem unemotional/uninterested, I will clarify that I’m thoughtful and like to process before I share opinions. To the comments that I seem like I am blowing people off, I say that I’m actually just really worn out from the day and in order to feel well-rested the next day I need to stay in. The more we can help clarify how we are perceived, the more people will understand you instead of project judgement inappropriately (see #6).</p>
<p className="tabbed">3. <b>Be upfront with your needs.</b> Tell people that you’re an introvert and won’t necessarily go to all of the social events with your friends. Don’t apologize for it, be matter-of-fact with explanation (see #2). I’ve found that by doing this, it may inspire others to realize their own needs too.</p>
<p className="tabbed">4. <b>Balance your relationships (i.e., have extrovert friends).</b> It can be easy for me to go unchecked with my hermit status if left to my own devices. If I surround myself with friends who appreciate my needs but also hold me accountable to getting out of the house, it becomes a much more healthy balance. Because as an introvert, I love my solitude, but I also love my friends and family.</p>
<p className="tabbed">5. <b>Plan.</b> Being an introvert does not mean you are shy (you can be, of course, but they do not come hand-in-hand). If there is an event where you know you’ll be around a lot of people, have a lot of interactions, publicly speak etc. schedule time afterwards to have your solitary recharge. Take a bathroom break and relax for an extra minute or two. Block time off your calendar for yourself so no one else can book time in your office.</p>
<p className="tabbed">6. <b>Educate others.</b> 99% of the time when I tell someone I’m an introvert, they’re surprised. Every time this happens, I see it as a perfect chance to advocate for understanding introversion. I explain how I am an introvert and that being an introvert does not mean a person is shy (among other things).</p>
<p>I hope these tips are helpful if you’re like me and feel that so much of social and business success is set up for extrovert success. I believe this balance is shifting little by little, but for the time being take these steps to own it!</p>

<p>When I was in residency, I worked every third weekend without a compensated day off. This meant 12 days straight of 10-12 hour workdays every third week. When you work weekends, the ones that you don't are essential to mental survival. And now that I’m in a position without working weekends, I’m still not used to the idea of truly being able to turn my brain off work at my own discretion. Here are 6 things I learned to keep in mind as I headed into a free weekend and prepared for the week ahead.</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>Go to bed and wake up at normal times.</b> Give yourself some liberty of course, but I find that when I succumb to the temptation of staying up late binge-watching Netflix and YouTube, I regret it the next morning. There are two possibilities: I wake up at early anyway because my body is used to it from the work week and am tired all day, or I wake up too late and lose half the day feeling groggy from oversleeping. Do yourself a favor and sleep at a normal time, but at least wake up while the sun is out.</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. <b>When you wake up, get up.</b> There's a lot of temptation to wake up and noodle around. Trust me, I've woken up and stayed in bed for hours and the next thing I know it's past noon and I'm starving because I haven't had breakfast and now I have a headache from caffeine withdrawal. Don't stray too far away from your usual morning routine and in fact supplement it with home-cooked breakfast and coffee with the TV on. The important thing is to get out of bed and don't go back for a while.</p>
<p className="tabbed">3. <b>Prioritize.</b> While you have your morning coffee and catch on the TV shows you missed during the week, write down the list of things you want to do over the weekend, and the things you HAVE to do (not work-related). It sucks to get back to Monday not having done your groceries or bought more toilet paper when you had two free days to do it.</p>
<p className="tabbed">4. <b>Schedule a microadventure.</b> This may require some pre-planning, or you could be totally spontaneous. Since I’ve moved to New York City, I subscribed to <a href="https://theskint.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Skint</a> which is a daily subscription of low-cost and free activities going on in any of the 5 boroughs. I like to use it to get myself out of the house if there’s something I’m interested in. I find <a href="https://coffeemeetspolished.com/articles/9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">microadventures</a> a great mindfulness activity and distraction from checking my email.</p>
<p className="tabbed">5. Do your self-care activities. This can be whatever you want. The important thing is to do it. You can check out my Sunday Self-Care routine <a href="https://coffeemeetspolished.com/articles/10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p className="tabbed">6. Unplug. Don't check your email for at least one of the days. I usually pick Saturday so that Sunday evening I can prepare for the week ahead. Practice mindfulness by minimizing your time on the devices and doing things like read a book, play board games, try a new restaurant, take a walk.</p>
<p>I hope these ideas help you maximize the free time you have on a weekend. It’s only 2 days for most of us, but there is so much you can do that has a huge impact on your resilience and mental health.</p>

<p>We all remember where we were that day. I was in 8th grade and had gotten to school early for a meeting for the Yearbook Club before first period. I did not see the first plane, but I did see the second plane because all of the TV’s in the school turned on immediately. And I remember watching the towers fall. Honestly, that’s all I can remember specifically. I don’t remember what I learned in school that day, or anything else afterwards.</p>
<p>If you’re like me, here’s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_for_the_day_of_the_September_11_attacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">timeline</a> to serve as a reminder as we honor the lives who were lost, heroes who saved helped save lives by sacrificing their own, and citizens and leaders who helped rebuild the nation thereafter.</p>
<p>7:59 a.m.: American Airlines Flight 11, a Boeing 767 carrying 81 passengers and 11 crew members, departs 14 minutes late from Logan International Airport in Boston, bound for Los Angeles International Airport. Five hijackers are aboard.</p>
<p>8:14: United Airlines Flight 175, a Boeing 767, carrying 56 passengers and nine crew members, departs 14 minutes late from Logan International Airport in Boston, bound for Los Angeles International Airport. Five hijackers are aboard.</p>
<p>8:14: Flight 11 is hijacked over central Massachusetts, turning southwest.</p>
<p>8:20: American Airlines Flight 77, a Boeing 757 with 58 passengers and six crew members, departs 10 minutes late from Washington Dulles International Airport, for Los Angeles International Airport. Five hijackers are aboard.</p>
<p>8:42: United Airlines Flight 93, a Boeing 757 with 37 passengers and seven crew members, departs 42 minutes late from Newark International Airport, bound for San Francisco International Airport. Four hijackers are aboard.</p>
<p>8:42–8:46 (approx.): Flight 175 is hijacked above Albany, New York, about 140 miles north of New York City, turning south.</p>
<p>8:46:40: Flight 11 crashes into the north face of the North Tower (1 WTC) of the World Trade Center, between floors 93 and 99. The aircraft enters the tower intact.</p>
<p>8:50–8:54 (approx.): Flight 77 is hijacked above southern Ohio, turning to the southeast.</p>
<p>9:03:00: Flight 175 crashes into the south face of the South Tower (2 WTC) of the World Trade Center, between floors 77 and 85. Parts of the plane, including the starboard engine, leave the building from its east and north sides, falling to the ground six blocks away.</p>
<p>9:28: Flight 93 is hijacked above northern Ohio, turning to the southeast.</p>
<p>9:37:46: Flight 77 crashes into the western side of The Pentagon and starts a violent fire.</p>

<p>10:03:11: Flight 93 is crashed by its hijackers and passengers, due to fighting in the cockpit 80 miles (129 km) southeast of Pittsburgh in Somerset County, Pennsylvania. Later reports indicate that passengers had learned about the World Trade Center and Pentagon crashes and were resisting the hijackers. The 9/11 Commission believed that Flight 93's target was either the United States Capitol building or the White House in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>10:28:22: The North Tower of the World Trade Center collapses, 1 hour, 42 minutes after the impact of Flight 11. The Marriott Hotel, located at the base of the two towers, is also destroyed.</p>
<p>10:50:19: Five stories of part of the Pentagon collapse due to the fire.</p>
<p>5:20:33 p.m.: 7 World Trade Center, a 47-story building, collapses.</p>
<p>Despite not remembering this timeline minute-by-minute, I remember the feelings I had, of fear and curiosity as to what was happening in the world. As an 8th grader the important things in my life were making sure I practiced enough for my piano lessons and when the next time I would talk to my crush was. I was just exploring things like makeup and hair straightening. Then something so significant happened in the world and I didn’t understand that it would cause a chain of events that would continue to affect my day-to-day now. I didn’t know at the time that I would live in New York City at Ground Zero and get to experience the memorialization of this day 16 years ago.</p>
<p>I learned what terrorism as an 8th grader. There are those around the world who learn what terrorism is before they even learn how to walk. Today, the threat of terrorism still exists but it has also empowered and strengthened the activism against it.</p>
<p>I value perspective and open-mindedness. The older I get, the more I see the definitions of “good” and “bad” are incredibly complex, and may not even exist at all in some cases. After moving from North Carolina to New York City, my eyes have opened further to the value diversity plays in peaceful co-existence. I hope to bask in it now, but wherever I go continue to spread the same beliefs. With diversity of culture, race, gender, sexual orientation, comes a beautiful synergy of innovation and strength that the world needs more than ever.</p>

<p>Smoothies are one of my favorite ways to sneak nutrients into my body that I may otherwise not want to have by themselves because of taste, texture, etc. Here are 4 things I add into every smoothie I make that I don’t even notice are there but give me tons of added benefits.</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>Spinach.</b> I used to hate spinach, but now I love it. I get bags of them for salads, in sandwiches, cooked in pasta, and more. For smoothies, I’ll even use frozen spinach because I get some more bang for my buck that way. Spinach is an awesome source of vitamin K, vitamin A, iron, folate, vitamin B’s, fiber, and more. Pharmacist note: if you’re on warfarin, don’t change your spinach intake without letting your physician know because it may change your INR levels.</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. <b>Flaxseed.</b> A bag of ground flaxseed lasts so for many smoothies. This is a great source of omega-3 essential fatty acids, fiber, and vitamin B1. Adding this to my morning smoothies definitely gets the intestines moving. One option is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DOKFLYI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00DOKFLYI&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=c838e1986c6cf71ab89daf8347e46d5d" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectrum Essentials Organic Ground Flaxseed, 24 Ounce</a>.</p>
<p className="tabbed">3. <b>Chia seeds.</b> These are full of antioxidants, fiber, and protein. And they help thicken your smoothie, too! One option is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AQFGL3O/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00AQFGL3O&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=e9af5418f1a48916678a5bbbef92d5a7" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nutiva Organic Chia Seed, Black, 32 Ounce</a>.</p>
<p className="tabbed">4. <b>Kefir/Greek yogurt.</b> Kefir looks like milk but it’s so much more. It’s filled with nutrients (protein, calcium, vitamin B12, vitamin D) and probiotics that aid in digestion and the health of your gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Greek yogurt has similar benefits.</p>
<p>With these I get in a lot of nutrients and fiber I (unfortunately) don't in other meals of the day. I can't taste the difference except with the seeds but it doesn't feel any different than having some strawberries or kiwi. I hope you give these a try!</p>

<p>We all have goals for ourselves but many of us find ourselves unable to achieve them and feel too discouraged to persevere. I’ve been in that boat so many times. Each time I’ve not achieved a goal and reflect as to why, I realize that the reasons for not reaching my goals are not because of our innate skills but rather how we set our goals. Many of us set lofty goals for ourselves assuming setting a goal is all that's needed and the rest will naturally fall into place. “Dream big”, “Reach for the stars!” we hear.</p>
<p>I’m not saying not to reach for the highest heights in ourselves. However, setting goals that are actually achievable is vital for long term resilience and morale to reach the next one. One tool I was taught and now been using throughout my career for yearly evaluations is setting S.M.A.R.T. goals. Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-based.</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>Specific.</b> This is the What, Why, and How of your goal.</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. <b>Measurable.</b> Goals need to be measurable so you know that you have actually accomplished them.</p>
<p className="tabbed">3. <b>Achievable.</b> You should stretch your limits with your goals but also set them with the appropriate level of knowledge and abilities to achieve them.</p>
<p className="tabbed">4. <b>Relevant.</b> We can set goals that can be specific, measurable, and achievable, but without a strategic direction for ourselves, then we are treading water.</p>
<p className="tabbed">5. <b>Time-Based.</b> Setting a timeframe creates a pragmatic sense of urgency between current reality and the goal.</p>
<p>To see the tool used through an example, we'll have one goal said with and without SMART methodology.</p>
<p className="tabbed"><b>Without SMART:</b> Read for pleasure more often.</p>
<p>What books define “reading for pleasure”? How will I know I’ve accomplished this? How many books in what frequency defines “more often”? Let’s try this again.</p>
<p className="tabbed"><b>With SMART:</b> Read <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307352153/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0307352153&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=f67145ea9f2514d0cb2424ffdab01772">Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking</a> by the end of the September.</p>
<p>Here, you can see I’ve set a specific book and timeframe. Now that I’ve set this, I can figure out my pace to set sub-goals and make sure I’m keeping on track each week.</p>
<p>Once you set your goals, it's important to reflect at the end of each time period. Ask yourself these questions:</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. What goals did I achieve? Celebrate these!</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. What goals did I not achieve?</p>
<p className="tabbed">3. Of the goals I did not achieve, what progress did I make towards them? Acknowledge and appreciate your progress.</p>
<p className="tabbed">4. Of the reasons why a goal did not get accomplished, which reasons were under my own control?</p>
<p className="tabbed">5. Of the reasons that were under my own control, how can I improve for the next time to get closer to my goal?</p>
<p>Achieving our goals is an iterative process. Remember, life is a marathon, not a sprint. Don't beat yourself down if a goal isn't achieved at the exact time you allotted. Instead, see it as an opportunity to learn and grow.</p>

<p>I can’t believe it’s already the end of August. I know I’m in the majority of people feeling this way, but this has been a pretty big month for me with starting my first training-wheels-off job since residency. I’ve been learning to orient myself in a brand new environment and learning a new frontier in my pursuit of work-life integration. As I reflect on the past month before embarking on September, here are five things I loved in August.</p>
<h4><b>roses.</b></h4>
<img src="/images/anniversary-roses.jpg" alt="Anniversary Roses" />
<p>This August was my boyfriend and my two-year dating anniversary! I came home to beautiful roses and it reminded me of the roses he would get me on his walks home in our North Carolina neighborhood. We've had a lot of experiences in the past two years and he's put up with a lot of my stress during residency. Now that I'm into the next phase of my career and our lives in New York City I'm so excited for the future with my best friend.</p>
<h4><b>unlimited metrocard pass.</b></h4>
<img src="/images/metro-card.jpg" alt="MetroCard" />
<p>Once my job started I bought a 30-unlimited <a href="http://web.mta.info/metrocard/mcgtreng.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MetroCard</a> since I take a train to work every day. I'm grateful for the world of exploration the train opens for me. I'm able to get from one end to Manhattan to another in less than 30 minutes on a direct line and check out different boroughs. I love being able to ride the train to new adventures.</p>
<h4><b>citi bike.</b></h4>
<img src="/images/citi-bike.jpg" alt="Citi Bike" />
<p>Once I got a <a href="https://www.citibikenyc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Citi Bike</a> subscription the possibilities to explore grew even more. The bike allows us to go places that trains don't as conveniently (I.e, across Central Park) and with distances greater than I feel like walking in the New York City summer heat. At only $163/year for unlimited 45-minute rides, I can't NOT participate.</p>
<h4><b>clinique cheek pop in berry pop.</b></h4>
<img src="/images/clinique-pop.jpg" alt="Clinique Pop" />
<p>I've been experimenting with different parts of my makeup routine that I didn't used to do and now there are some I can't feel complete without. One of them is <b>blush</b>. I've had this product since my initial makeup-loving/self-empowerment phase began a few years ago and would use it sometimes but wasn't comfortable with it. Now that I've had more experience with different formulations I realize why it gets such good reviews. I love how buildable it is and lasts all day. Not to mention a gorgeous color!</p>
<h4><b>central park in the summer.</b></h4>
<img src="/images/central-park-summer.jpg" alt="Central Park Summer" />
<p>This place will forever have a special spot in my heart. I call it our back yard for good reason - it's a half an avenue away from our door. We've had access to it since the day we moved and it’s been a beautiful escape from our otherwise urban environment. The views, the bike rides, the fresh air, the free music, the free performances. I wanted to capture this moment because it represents our beginning here.</p>
<p>All in all, August was an amazing month. I started my career and this blog, I started a new life in a brand new place, and I'm continuing to find my ever-evolving sense of self. Thank you for embarking on this journey with me!</p>

<p>One of my favorite parts of any makeup routine is eyeshadow. I don’t consider myself creative or artistic, but with eyeshadows I feel that I’m able to completely transform my look and feel more confident. Whether it’s a simple look while still half-asleep in the morning or ultra glam for a night out, I have a lot of fun doing it. <b>Remember: makeup should first and foremost be applied for you, not anyone else.</b></p>
<p>Here are my essential, everyday eyeshadows. These are the ones that I travel with and reach for with almost every look. These are basically my default shadows when I’m on autopilot. For reference, I’m a Filipina and have medium brown skin with neutral undertones (Mac NW44, Revlon Colorstay Combination/Oily in Toast, Maybelline Matte Fit Me Matte + Poreless Foundation in Natural Tan). I have very dark brown eyes and my eyelids get oily so I prime and set with a base every time.</p>

You don't need to spend hundreds of dollars for a massage and spa to reap the benefits of self-care. Here's a compilation of my Sunday self-care routine. </p> <a href="/articles/10">[Read More]</a></div>, post: 
<div>
<img src="/images/sunday-self-care.jpg" alt="Sunday Self Care" />
<p>Sundays are really important for me to feel I can tackle the week ahead. When I was a resident, the Sundays I wasn’t working were the days I felt I had control of my life. As transient as that feeling was once Monday hit, I still saw Sundays as a chance to start fresh. With the limited time to re-group, I developed the essential habits I continue to do now. Some of these may seem a bit *basic*, but I’ve learned that a compilation of what seem like little things become significant for self-care. You don’t need to spend hundreds of dollars for a massage and spa to reap the benefits (although, more power to you if can!). </p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>Tidy the house.</b> It really is true that a tidy space helps develop a healthy mind. Don’t get me wrong, I am NOT a neat freak. I leave my clothes on the floor and don’t wash dishes immediately and never make my bed. But when clutter comes at the cost of not knowing where your essential things are and you create obstacle courses in your room, it can deter from the focus of your self-care routine. You can control the cleanliness of your environment, so take advantage of it and tidy up. I make it a Sunday morning ritual after breakfast and it sets a great stage for the rest of the day.</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. <b> Meal prep.</b> Monday mornings are tough. Tuesday mornings are tough. Let’s face it, if you’re not a morning person then most of them are tough. I do as much as I can on Sunday’s to minimize the thinking I have to do each the morning. Sundays are usually one of my grocery days and it gives me a fighting chance to actually bring my lunch to work. In addition to preparing lunch, I also take the opportunity to cook a nice Sunday night meal. It’s a good mindfulness activity for me.</p>
<p className="tabbed">3. <b>Weekly goals.</b> By the late afternoon I’m ready to check my work email and calendar. It’s important to be able to see the week’s landscape on Sunday while your mind has rested than on Monday morning when you’re expected to be “on” from the moment you step into the office. See what fires may be brewing for the week and what tasks must get done. By preparing on Sunday you’re able to be less reactionary to what is happening around you and take control of whatever situations arise.</p>
<p className="tabbed">4. <b>Nail care.</b> This is an example of one #treatyoself I like to do on Sundays when I have the time to paint my nails and not do anything for a while as they dry. Nail care is something that helps me to feel polished and confident. Treat yourself to what you enjoy to feel pampered and polished.</p>
<p className="tabbed">5. <b>Skin care.</b> This is another example of my self-pamper regimen. I like to mask either with clay or a sheet depending on what I think my skin needs are. Putting on a mask is a mindfulness activity for me while doubling as skin care. It also helps me not look so tired on Monday morning (but coffee does this, too!). If you’re looking for a great, affordable, heavy duty clay mask, try out <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014P8L9W/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0014P8L9W&linkCode=as2&tag=offeeeetsolis-20&linkId=2cfe5b6a34a4eb1d543e9a60860fe801">Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay</a>. My boyfriend and I will do these masks together and our faces feel so soft and clean afterwards!</p>
<p>These are a few examples of little things you can do to feel empowered to kick ass and take names at work this week. The important thing is to find what works for you and dedicate to self-care.</p>

<p>I just finished my third week on the job. One thing I’m still getting used to transitioning from resident to full-fledged pharmacist is not feeling guilty about taking time to do things other than work. As a resident, there were usually so many things to get done that you didn’t know how to take a mental break. And if you made the choice to not work, many would feel odd about it knowing that there was someone else still working.</p>
<p>But now, living in New York City there is always so much to do right outside your door. I have no choice but to disconnect from work and enjoy everything around me. Here’s a taste of microadventures of the week.</p>
<img src="/images/nycfc.jpg" alt="NYCFC" />
<p>My boyfriend and I were given some tickets to a New York City FC soccer game in Yankee Stadium. It was a lot of fun! And I got to see the Bronx for the first time.</p>
<img src="/images/salmon-don.jpg" alt="Salmon Don" />
<p>We also tried a new spot on 82nd St. and Amsterdam Ave. called <a href="http://www.jinramen.com/uws_menu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" > Jin Ramen</a>. I didn’t get ramen, I got the Sake Ikura Don (marinated salmon sashimi, salmon roe, daikon, kaiware, shiso leaf, shredded egg, nori, and zuke sauce). It was delicious! But I’m biasedRead More I love raw salmon.</p>
<img src="/images/eclipse.jpg" alt="Eclipse" />
<p>We weren’t in the “path of totality” here in New York, but we got to see a part of the eclipse! I was able to borrow someone’s eclipse glasses at work to see it. Seeing the totality videos were truly amazing.</p>
<img src="/images/evening-walk.jpg" alt="Evening Walk" />
<p>After happy hour one night this week, the weather was perfect for a walk in Central Park. Made for a great photo, don’t you think?</p>

<p>My boyfriend and I went to a <a href="https://www.nycfc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> New York City FC </a>
 soccer match in Yankee Stadium, and on the subway back home we had chatted with a small group of kids ranging from 4 to 10 years old (my guess). They started chatting with us asking if we went to a soccer game based on the crowd and our attire. We talked about the game and they asked how much it was. When we said some seats were only $10-15 they looked at each other in excitement and one said, “We can save up our money and go to one of those!” They were so curious about sports, who we were, what we were doing there.</p>
<p>With every response it seemed they realized we weren’t distant adults with no possible things in common, but rather were giving them glimpses of hope that they could be doing things just like us. Riding the train with these kids even just for a few minutes I felt happiness in their curiosity and hopeful in their untainted attitudes toward what was around them.</p>
<p>We reached the stop where we would transfer trains, which was the same stop these kids were getting off to go home. Our next train was already at the station and we eagerly pushed our way through the crowd to try to make it. When we made it across to the next train, we saw the oldest kid there keeping the door open for us! “I got you,” he said. He had our backs, and it was SO awesome.</p>
<p>The first thing my boyfriend said when we sat on our next train home was, “Those kids need to go to a soccer game.”</p>
<p>It was such a refreshing interaction to speak to these kids. In the whirlwind of politics, career, and trying to get our own sh*t together, we can forget that we have to foster the next generation, too. We have to make our surroundings better than how we found it (or made it) so that kids like the ones we met never lose hope in their own possibilities.</p>

<div>
<img src="/images/youtube-lessons.jpg" alt="YouTube Lessons" />
<p>YouTube was founded in 2005 when I was a sophomore in high school(!). I still remember the yearbook that featured YouTube as one of the highlights of the year. My use of YouTube has evolved from primarily watching music videos to now being a source of anything I could think of. The first time I recall the concept of checking YouTube to learn how to do something was when my mom figured out how to fix some plumbing issues in our house while my dad was out of town. What a concept! But it wasn't until a couple of years ago I started using YouTube as my go-to for my visual/auditory learning needs. Below is a list of random things I've used YouTube to learn from.</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>How to tie buttons back on your clothes.</b> I had a pile of clothes that I refused to throw out because of a popped button, but at the same time kept putting off actually learning how to do it. One day I thought, if I use YouTube for other things, why not this? It totally worked.</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. <b>Excel functions.</b> I used these videos out of necessity during residency for my research and rotation projects.

<p>This August is the first one in my life that I will not be having a "first day of school". It's crazy to think, but also refreshing to be able to focus on developing my career on the job. I've had first days with a lot of different academic environments. In high school I was a big fish in a small pond. In college I was culture-shocked as a tiny tadpole in one of the Great Lakes. In pharmacy school it was ~150 people in the same lecture room all day long. And then getting my MS, it was a whirlwind balancing evening coursework with a full residency program. Each environment had its own challenges that built from the previous experience, but I believe the hardest transition of all was the one from high school to college. It almost feels like an extension of your teenage years where you think you're invincible but at the same time feel pressured to be a completely functional #adult. What does that mean, anyway?</p>
<p>Below are 10 things I would tell my college self!</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>Embrace not having things figured out.</b> College is a difficult time. You're trying to reconcile the structure you had in high school with the open freedom of living on your own for the first time. Throw in the highlight reels of social media and fantasy of TV shows/movies, and you have a perfect storm to create a ton of insecurity and identity crises. Now that I'm in my late 20's and just really getting going, I think back to my 18-22 year old time frame and think, "Man, I wish I had spent less time worry about finding my path and trying new things instead." You don't know what you don't know. Take advantage of it now so that when you have a lot more responsibility you will have the wisdom and perspective to ground you in the future.</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. <b>Fail.</b> This is something that may seem like a ridiculous tip if you're used to achieving everything you work towards. But by never failing, you don't develop the coping strategies to overcome the stumbles. In college, you have a lot of buffer around you that allows you to experiment and fail while still seeing the light of day. Reflect on what went wrong and what opportunities you could learn to improve. Have your support structure (mentors, family, friends) there for you as a sounding board (and shoulder to cry on). Know that you'll fail time and time again throughout the rest of your life. If you embrace it as a positive now and you will be able to develop building blocks of resilience in the future.</p>
<p className="tabbed">3. <b>Save money.</b> I'm hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt with no savings account. When I think back of all that I splurged on and money I spent to eat out just because I was lazy, I realize how much I could have automated to my savings account and never touched. I could have been in a much more financially stable place now if I had basic financial advising right out of high school (if not earlier).</p>
<p className="tabbed">4. <b>Go to class.</b> I can't emphasize this enough. It's so easy to skip once you go to college and your parents aren't keeping you accountable. I don't care if you pay attention (although you should), but get yourself out of bed and into the classroom. Not only will it help you start making good habits, but you'll do so much better in that class just by being there and listening for key examination points. Go with a friend! Help each other with class attendance.</p>
<p className="tabbed">5. <b>Take advantage of study hours.</b> In addition to going to class, if your class has homework assignments then go to study hours if you need help. Study hours are usually conducted by Teaching Assistants who have taken the class before, have an ear with the professor, helps write exams, grades exams, etc. Also, if you're like me and went to a large university with lecture halls filled with hundreds of students, study hours are a great way to get individualized attention to ask your questions in front of a smaller audience.</p>
<p className="tabbed">6. <b>Stay in your dorms for at least a year.</b> I left the dorms after a few months because I was uncomfortable. I spent a lot of time off campus at other apartments because my friends were older. By doing this I missed out on organized social events on campus, meeting new people in the dorms, and learning to persevere through the discomfort. My recommendation: lean in to everything your campus has to offer in your first year. Apartments will always be there later.</p>
<p className="tabbed">7. <b>Change your major.</b> The identity college students feel with their major is strong. It's essentially the equivalent to your name, since introductions always go to "What's your major?". The stamp of "Undecided" can feel like a dunce cap surrounded by people who seem like they have their lives figured out. The truth of the matter is, the major you have now may not land you the job you envision because you may change your interests, the workforce will change, and life will change. If you don't like what you're doing now after giving it a fair shot, take advantage of your resources and explore something new.</p>
<p className="tabbed">8. <b>Try a new hobby.</b> Campuses are full of clubs for anything you can think of. And if it doesn't exist, feel empowered to create it! Joining clubs and exploring hobbies are a great way to create balance in your life, have fun, and in some cases pursue leadership positions within the ranks.</p>
<p className="tabbed">9. <b>Learn to share spaces.</b> With the first taste of freedom of living on your own, it's easy to let go of the rest of your self-care. Make your bed, keep your room clean, wash your dishes, and maintain your regular hygiene. Odds are you share a space (dorm, kitchen, living room, bathroom, etc.). It's important now to develop productive habits and make sure your cone of freedom doesn't interfere with anyone else's.</p>
<p className="tabbed">10. <b>Don't isolate your family.</b> If you're lucky, you made it to college with the support of your family in one way or another. In this phase of your life you begin to learn that your parents are human beings who went through similar struggles with their sense of self. Take advantage of their wisdom. If they don't treat you like an independent adult yet, give them time to also learn to let go. And never deny the gift packages from home. Your roommates/dorm-mates will appreciate it, too!</p>

<img src="/images/makeup-skin-foundation.jpg" alt="Foundation and Skin Type" />
<p>I fully admit one of my guilty pleasures is binge-watching YouTube "beauty influencers". Whatever your skin type is and daily routine, it takes trial and error to find out what works for you. The Q&A below is for reference for you to know it doesn't always have to be a 10-step foundation routine to look flawless. Don't get me wrong, I have a lot of fun putting on makeup and when I know I have an evening event, I will plan to spend a lot of time on it. But for every day and getting ready for a long work day, what matters is what makes you feel comfortable and confident to take on your challenges.</p>
<p><b>What is your skin type?</b></p>
<p>I have oily skin, lucky me! I have occasional breakouts that leave pigmented scars. If you have oily skin too, I'm happy to share my tricks to controlling shine throughout the day. Hint - it starts with skin care.</p>
<p><b>What is your skin color and undertone?</b></p>
<p>I'm a Filipina and my skin color is brown with neutral undertones. For color reference, I use MAC NW 44, Revlon Colorstay Combination/Oily in Toast (370), and Maybelline Matte Fit Me Matte + Poreless Foundation in Natural Tan (320).</p>
<p><b>What tools do you use?</b></p>
<p>I've gone through a few different brushes, by my default brush to to blend out my foundation is the Morphe M439. I love how dense and short the bristles are and having the curved top as opposed to a flat top is more comfortable on the face. When I'm not too lazy to soak a Beauty Blender, I will use that too. But when I'm half awake in the morning on autopilot I pick up the brush.</p>
<p><b>How do you prep your face for foundation?</b></p>
<p>The very first thing I do when I wake up and before any makeup application is to wash it. I only do soap and water. I put on some lotion and wait 10 minutes, then I'm ready to go. This is usually when I start my coffee for the morning. As far as primer, I don't actually use those as much but I'm investigating some oil-control ones - stay tuned!</p>
<p><b>What do you use to set your face?</b></p>
<p>I keep it simple with powder to set the foundation. I find this to be essential if you have oily skin. Pictured is Estee Lauder Double Matte Oil-Control Pressed Powder in Medium/Deep (04). As you can see it's hitting pan and I plan to replace it with Maybelline Fit Me Pressed Powder next!</p>
<p><b>What are products you don't use every day?</b></p>
<p>When I'm getting ready for work in the morning, I keep it simple but effective. I don't use concealer under the eyes, instead I do a second layer of foundation. I don't use any sort of setting spray. And I don't contour/bronze. I am interested in pursuing this someday but for now, I only use blush and highlight.</p>

<p>One thing I learned quickly when moving to New York City was that brunch is a big deal. Every restaurant open has a brunch special of some sort. My boyfriend and I came up with our criteria for picking a place to actually stop and sit. Below are 4 considerations we have, along with some tips for the optimal experience in the end.</p>
<p className="tabbed">1. <b>Bottomless drink option vs. lower glass per glass.</b> Of course, drinks are the best part of brunch. There are options for a mimosa, blood Mary and bellini in many locations. Looking through different places there were some with $5 per drink options, and other discounted prices. But if you're not in a rush and you feel you'll drink more than 2 glasses, go for the bottomless option. With these morning cocktails ranging from $11-15, you can reap the benefits of the bottomless drink price after 2-3 drinks. Deciding between choices requires a little bit of calculation but worth the cost-savings in the end.</p>
<p className="tabbed">2. <b>Unlimited time for bottomless drinks.</b> If you find a spot with bottomless drinks, check the fine print. Some places will have a time limit to keep a table. This makes total sense from a business perspective, but as a consumer if you want to be somewhere for a few hours to optimize your cost per drink ratio, unlimited time options exist!</p>
<p className="tabbed">3. <b>See if you can eat at the bar.</b> In case you can't find a place that has unlimited time for your bottomless drinks, eat at the bar. This eliminates depending on your waiter/waitress for refills.</p>
<p className="tabbed">4. <b>Research the menu.</b> This one is obvious. You'll want to eat with all of the bottomless drinks. Make sure the menu looks good!</p>
<p>Where's my favorite brunch place so far? In my neighborhood on the Upper West Side, that would be <a href="http://www.ellakitchenbar.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Ella Kitchen & Bar</a>. This place hit all of the criteria. Bottomless drink option between mimosa, bloody mary, bellini, and cava for $17 with no time limit that we could see on the menu (we stayed ~1.5 hours). We ate at the bar and our bartender didn't let our glasses empty. We were able to switch between types of drinks - not sure if this was a bartender perk, but it didn't state against it on the menu. And the food. was. delicious.</p>
<img className="landscape" src="/images/brunch-cream-eggs.jpg" alt="Cream Eggs"/>
<p><b>Smoked Salmon Baked Eggs.</b>Three eggs, multigrain toast & home fries. Eggs are cooked with heavy cream & parmesan cheese. Smoked salmon with chives, dill & cream cheese. This was so sinfully good with the cream and cheeses. It came out on a cast iron platter, allowing the parmesan cheese to continue cooking into a delicious crust. The cream cheese was splattered in dollops and served as a scrumptious surprise since they were camouflaged with the cream and egg whites. I would order this every single time.</p>
<img className="landscape" src="/images/brunch-wellington.jpg" alt="The Wellington"/>
<p><b>Wellington Eggs Benedict.</b>Poached eggs on house-baked English muffin, roasted chile hollandaise & home fries. Grass-fed skirt steak & sauteed spinach. My boyfriend got this meal, and let's just say there was no leftover. Can you blame him?</p>
<p>Where are your favorite brunch spots, and how do you pick them?</p>

One of the most empowering lessons that I learned from my mentors is to prepare to orient yourself. Own it! Here are 10 tips that I will be implementing for at least the next few months. </p> <a href="/articles/3">[Read More]</a></div>, post: 
<div>
<img src="/images/orienting-yourself.jpg" alt="First Day!"/>
<p>I started my first training-wheels-off job last Monday and most things are different from where I trained. The culture, the people, the protocols, etc. As a resident, I was one of the Chief Residents for Orientation where I helped coordinate on-boarding 35 Pharmacy Residents. With my specialty training I also coordinated on-boarding of new Managers while on rotations, and had lectures on the importance of getting a good start as part of my Masters degree.</p>
<p>An effective orientation is like getting a good first impression. It can say a lot about an institution's overall organization and how engaged your hiring manager is. A quality orientation experience can improve employee retention and engagement in the long run. This means less employee turnover and apathy, better team morale, and cost savings (training is expensive!).</p>
<p>With all of the didactic training and coordination of orientation schedules/experiences for others, it's time to create the effective experience for myself.  One of the most empowering lessons that I learned from my mentors is to prepare to orient yourself. Own it!</p>
<p>Below are 10 tips that I will be implementing for at least the next few months.</p>
<p className="tabbed">		1. <b>Keep an open mind.</b> You don't know what you don't know. Seek to understand. All of these phrases basically mean, shut up and listen. Don't kid yourself thinking that you know, well, anything. It's a great place to be for now - embrace it.</p>
<p className="tabbed">		2. <b>What got you here won't get you there.</b> Similar to the previous one, don't think that the knowledge you had that got you hired is what is going to make you the most successful. Keep your cards to yourself until you understand the organization first. Blow their minds with your abilities after you've earned their trust.</p>
<p className="tabbed">		3. <b>Focus on building relationships.</b> You are not a one person show. If you are onboarding to a new organization, large or small, everyone has a place. And relationships are key. Get a feel for who you can go to for certain needs, who could be a mentor, and who can collaborate with in the future.</p>
<p className="tabbed">		4. <b>Get lost.</b> Try to find places on your own (but don't be afraid to ask for directions so you're not late!). By walking places on your own instead of having someone escort you, you'll get lost less in the long run. And you may even find some secret spots to have lunch in solitude.</p>
<p className="tabbed">		5. <b>Bring paper and pen.</b> It still sets a good first impression than taking notes on a mobile device. I always start with writing things down in my moleskin notebook until I see examples of otherwise.</p>
<p className="tabbed">		6. <b>Under promise and over deliver.</b> Your career is a marathon, not a sprint. All of my mentors have advised not to join too many committees, promise too many deliverables to start, etc. Be a productive and effective team member and understand the culture/politics around you. When the time is right, flex your muscles.</p>
<p className="tabbed">		7. <b>Trust the process.</b> Remember that while all organizations have room for improvement, you do not have the historical context behind decisions that give you the bandwidth to make any change recommendations just yet. Trust the process, keep notes of what went well and what didn't, and when the time is right discuss these opportunities with your hiring manager.</p>
<p className="tabbed">		8. <b>Communicate.</b> Over communicate with your hiring manager. The more you communicate now, the more trust you will build with your boss. Communicate when you are unsure. You will likely have different people orienting you throughout the process and people will over- or under-assume you know anything. Tell your trainers upfront where you are in the process, and don't let them assume you know something you don't. On the other hand, don't let your trainers speak too long about things you already know because that wastes everyone's time. Speak up for yourself - this is your time and sets the platform for the rest of your time at the institution.</p>
<p className="tabbed">		9. <b>Build good habits from day 1.</b> This is your opportunity to set your environment within appropriate bounds. Your email is empty so you can start your organization system from scratch. You can create your boundaries for working after hours/weekends now (unless your boss has different expectations). If you build good habits now, it will help in the long run for resilience in the workplace and happiness at home.</p>
<p className="tabbed">		10. <b>Start with the basics.</b> Learn where the bathroom is, how to clock in, make sure you get paid.</p>
<p>Stay tuned to see if these tips worked for me in the long run. I hope some of these will work for you.</p>

There is still so much more to learn and I choose to see it as a fun challenge.

<div>
<img src="/images/graduation-end.jpg" alt="graduation:" />
<p>I was raised in a family and culture where education meant success. If you did well in school, the rest of your life would fall into place. Well, I've gotten a lot of higher education throughout the past couple of decades with three degrees to my name (BS, PharmD, MS). And while I've held jobs as I progressed through my coursework, and staffed as part of my residency program, the graduation days have finally ended and the training wheels are off. At 28 years old, I officially have entered the next step of my career.</p> 
<p>What's funny about it is that I feel like I'm learning the same #adulting struggles now as those just finishing their undergraduate degrees. Except now I'm in much more debt and haven't been able to hold a saving's account because of school. Coming out of it and transitioning to the workforce, I wonder if it was worth it. At times I feel really behind after all of those long days, sleep lost, and money left on the table. I'm in my late 20's and just learning about 401k's, taxable income, and health insurance (despite being a healthcare professional). But at least I know how to cook?</p> 
<p>The truth is, without all of the experiences I had before today I wouldn't be exploring New York City with someone I love, with the potential for amazing new experiences ahead of us. Yes, I've spent a lot of my life studying and struggling, but I learned so much along the way. I learned a lot about life, what I want from it, and how to get it. I've gained independence and perspective that had I rushed out into the real world a decade earlier I may not have in the same way.</p> 
<p>What I've learned is that when the graduation days end, life is just beginning. There is still so much more to learn and I choose to see it as a fun challenge. If you're in a similar boat where you are coming into the workforce feeling behind, I encourage you to take on the challenge with a positive perspective. Take value in where you came from, the mistakes you made, and accomplishments you earned. Use them to take on the unknown future and make it what you want.</p>

<p>Welcome to Coffee Meets Polished, a forum to share everything from what we enjoy when we are our bare-it-all selves with our first coffee of the day, to when we have to go out into the world as our more polished selves.</p>
<b>Who are you?</b>
<p>My name is Erin and I'm an introvert, millenial, and self-proclaimed feminist with a career as a healthcare professional and leader.</p>
<p>I studied Biology at the University of Florida and moved to North Carolina for pharmacy school at UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy. While in pharmacy school I led a Communications and Social Media Management team for a national pharmacy organization where I discovered a new skill set and creative avenue to engage audiences. We focused on sharing stories of other student pharmacists to create a national platform idea promotion and collegiality.</p>
<p>Once I became a licensed pharmacist, I stayed in Chapel Hill two more years for residency where I specialized in Health-System Pharmacy Administration (yes, that's a specialty). Residency was an ironic experience where you're too swamped to focus on yourself but get broken to the point where you learn a lot about who you are. Through the serial burnout and rising from the ashes I was empowered to embrace my strengths (and many quirks), seek and accept help, and pursue personal passions - not just professional ones.</p>
<p>Now I'm in New York City pursuing the next step in my professional career in a brand new environment but finally without the training wheels on. Luckily I get to have my love by my side, too. You'll get to meet him throughout the journey!</p>
<b>Ok, but why did you start this blog?</b>
<p>I created this blog to share my story in hopes that if others can relate, they realize they're not alone. I feel most myself when I wake up on a Saturday morning and drink coffee while catching up on my YouTube subscriptions. But I also feel myself in wedges and a blazer managing projects and taking care of patients. One cannot exist without the other. This blog represents my continuous quest for the appropriate level of integration (not balance) of my personal and professional lives.</p>
<b>But, what do I get out of it?</b>
<p>It’s my hope that you may be able to relate or find tools that will work for you to create the necessary boundaries between home and work to maintain resilience and happiness. At a minimum, my goal is that you leave this page feeling happy with you who are. If I'm lucky, you'll feel empowered to make a difference in the world.</p>
<p>Thanks for joining, and welcome!</p>
